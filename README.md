# Opentelemetry 
##The installation of OpenTelemetry depends on your programming language and the components you want to use. Here is a general overview of the installation steps for the OpenTelemetry components:
1- Choose your programming language: OpenTelemetry supports many programming languages, including Java, Python, Go, .NET, Ruby, and Node.js.
2- Install the OpenTelemetry SDK: The SDK is the core component of OpenTelemetry that provides the API for instrumenting your applications with telemetry data. You can install the SDK using a package manager or by downloading the binary from the OpenTelemetry website. 
```
pip install opentelemetry-sdk
pip install opentelemetry-api
pip install opentelemetry-exporter-otlp
```
3-Choose your exporter: OpenTelemetry supports many exporters that allow you to export your telemetry data to various backends, such as Prometheus, Zipkin, Jaeger, or Elasticsearch. You can choose one or more exporters to use, depending on your needs.
In our case we are using influxDB as exporter, here the steps to install and configure it:
The first way : 
  Go to the InfluxDB downloads page at: https://docs.influxdata.com/influxdb/v2.0/install/
  Select the version of InfluxDB that you want to download based on your operating system.
  Download the InfluxDB package to your computer.
  Extract the package to specified directory .
  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the package is located.
  Run influx with write : 
  ``` ./influxd ```
  InfluxDB service will be run in : http//localhost:8086/
The second way :
  Go to the InfluxDB downloads page at https://portal.influxdata.com/downloads/.
  Select the version of InfluxDB that you want to download based on your operating system and architecture. For example, if you are using Ubuntu Linux, you can select the .deb package for your architecture.
  Download the InfluxDB package to your computer.
  Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the directory where the package is located.
  Install InfluxDB by running the appropriate command for your operating system. For example, on Ubuntu Linux, you can run the following command to install the .deb package:
  ``` sudo dpkg -i influxdb_<version>_amd64.deb ```
After the installation is complete, start the InfluxDB service by running the following command: 
``` sudo systemctl start influxdb ```
Verify that the service is running by running the following command:
```sudo systemctl status influxdb ```
You should see output indicating that the service is active and running.
